    * 'cd~'
    * 'curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer'
    * Test the installation by running 'composer' in the terminal
    * Ensure that your home/'username'/.config/ folder is  writtable

3. Run the command below to install Laravel globally via Laravel Installer
    'composer global require "laravel/installer"'

4. Now we have to add global access
    * Open .bashrc by running this command 'sudo gedit .bashrc'. Feel free to use anything other than gedit. You'll be prompted to enter your password.
    * Add this line at the end of the file and save it
      'PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin"'
    * Run this command after saving the .bashrc file

5. Navigate to lh-ehr-laravel-port directory
    'cd lh-ehr-laravel-port'

6. Add your .env file by running this command: 'cp .env.example .env'

7. Add your .env file to .gitignore filename. // It is already there, just check!

8. Generate key for your application by running the command below
    'php artisan key:generate'
   Observe that the key is inserted in your .env file.

9. Edit your database name, username and password in your .env file
    DB_DATABASE = your_db_name

    DB_PASSWORD = your_password

10. Now, you can create the database by running
    'php artisan make:database'

11. Create tables by running
    'php artisan migrate'

12. You can seed the database width
    'php artisan db:seed' // This shouldn't work for now.
    If seeding fails, then use the librereportgenerator.sql file in this directory to import sample data.

13. Start the application by running the command below in the terminal:
        'php artisan serve'

14. Head over to your browser and access http://localhost:8000 or 127.0.0.1:8000
